CSS Box model: Every element in HTML is "wrapped" in a box. It's made up of 4 parts, "content, border, margin and padding".
By targeting one of those areas we can better define spaces between elements, and align things. You can view the box 
by using the inspect element option on your browser.

Grid vs. Flexbox: Flexbox and Grid are Layout Modules.
Flexbox is used when you're only concerned about either a row OR a column; it's one dimensional. 
Grid is two dimensional and is used when you want to target both a column and a row and ensure it's lined up.

CSS' role in accessibility is with styling/presentation(HTML for structure). Ensure that there is enough color contrast between the text and the background.
Use consistent font styles as well as readable and consistent font sizes.
